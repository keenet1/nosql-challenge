## Repository Overview:
This repository contains the deliverables for a three-part homework assignment:
- Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up (NoSQL_setup.ipynb).
- Part 2: Update the Database (NoSQL_setup.ipynb).
- Part 3: Exploratory Analysis (NoSQL_analysis.ipynb).

## Background
Text from assignment: "The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles."

For parts 1 and 2, a mongoimport command line was used to import a file titled "establishments.json" resulting in the creation of a database named uk_food and a collection named establishments. Once created, the database was then updated to include the details of a new restaurant. For part 3, the database was queried to obtain the answers to four questions.
